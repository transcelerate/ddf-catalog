# Digital Data Flow (DDF) Solution Catalog
Welcome to the DDF Solution Catalog, here you will find a growing list of self-reported solutions which utilize and follow the DDF Unified Study Definitions Model (USDM). Below you will find a list of solutions which are currently using the USDM and other DDF tools to help promote developing and using fully digitized protocols. Please use this list as a starting point for researching DDF compatible solutions and come back frequently as our list of solutions and use cases grows!

# How to use the catalog:
Our current iteration of the DDF Solution Catalog is meant to provide basic functionality for capturing and displaying solutions as they are submitted. New solutions will always be appended to the bottom of the table in the order they are submitted, and we will work hard to ensure there are no duplications or misrepresentations in the material.

Each line of the table represents a unique solution, and will contain the following information:

* Organization Name - Name of company or team which owns the solution.
* Solution Name - Name of the specific DDF compatible solution.
